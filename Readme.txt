A port scanner is a computer program that checks network ports for one of three possible statuses â€“ open, closed, or filtered.

Port scanners are valuable tools in diagnosing network and connectivity issues. However, attackers use port scanners to detect possible access points for infiltration and to identify what kinds of devices you are running on the network, like firewalls, proxy servers or VPN servers.
